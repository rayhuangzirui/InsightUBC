This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps

1. Start the server before running frontend. To start the server, at the directory: `project_team231/src`, run the following commands:
	### `ts-node App.ts`
	Server will start at [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321).


2. In the frontend directory: `project_team231/frontend`, you can run:

   ### `yarn start`

	Runs the app in the development mode.\
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
